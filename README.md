# Delaunay-Triangulation
This was a program I created as part of my coursework for MM2090(Introduction to Scientific Computing).
The program Implements the Delaunay Triangulation algorithm to triangulate the surface of a rectangle with a user specified number of triangles that are numbered and colored different from its neighbours in SageMath. Most of the program is essentially in python with a few classes from SageMath mostly for the Graphics.
